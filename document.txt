Variable Declaration and Input:

char op;: Declares a variable op to store the arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /).
float num1, num2;: Declares variables num1 and num2 to store the operands.
User Interaction:

cout << "Enter an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /): ";: Prompts the user to enter an arithmetic operator.
cin >> op;: Reads the operator input from the user.
cout << "Enter two numbers as operands: ";: Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
cin >> num1 >> num2;: Reads the operands input from the user.
Switch Statement (switch(op)):

Determines which arithmetic operation to perform based on the value of op.
Case Statements:

Case '+': Adds num1 and num2 and prints the result.
Case '-': Subtracts num2 from num1 and prints the result.
Case '*': Multiplies num1 and num2 and prints the result.
Case '/': Checks if num2 is not zero before dividing num1 by num2. If num2 is zero, prints an error message for division by zero.
Default Case: Handles unsupported operators by printing an error message.
Output:

Each case in the switch statement outputs the operation being performed along with the result.
Error Handling:

The program checks for division by zero (num2 == 0) in the division case to avoid runtime errors.
